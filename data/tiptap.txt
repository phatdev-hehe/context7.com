TITLE: React Editor Usage Example with Performance Optimizations in JSX
DESCRIPTION: Example demonstrating the optimized React editor integration with performance controls. Shows how to use useEditor and useEditorState hooks with various optimization options like immediatelyRender and shouldRerenderOnTransaction.

LANGUAGE: jsx
CODE:
const editor = useEditor({
  /**
   * This option gives us the control to enable the default behavior of rendering the editor immediately.
   */
  immediatelyRender: true,
  /**
   * This option gives us the control to disable the default behavior of re-rendering the editor on every transaction.
   */
  shouldRerenderOnTransaction: false,
  extensions: [StarterKit],
  content: `
    <p>
      A highly optimized editor that only re-renders when it's necessary.
    </p>
    `,
});

/**
 * This hook allows us to select the editor state we want to use in our component.
 */
const currentEditorState = useEditorState({
  /**
   * The editor instance we want to use.
   */
  editor,
  /**
   * This selector allows us to select the data we want to use in our component.
   * It is evaluated on every editor transaction and compared to it's previously returned value.
   * You can return any data shape you want.
   */
  selector: (ctx) => ({
    isBold: ctx.editor.isActive("bold"),
    isItalic: ctx.editor.isActive("italic"),
    isStrike: ctx.editor.isActive("strike"),
  }),
  /**
   * This function allows us to customize the equality check for the selector.
   * By default it is a `===` check.
   */
  equalityFn: (prev, next) => {
    // A deep-equal function would probably be more maintainable here, but, we use a shallow one to show that it can be customized.
    if (!next) {
      return false;
    }
    return (
      prev.isBold === next.isBold &&
      prev.isItalic === next.isItalic &&
      prev.isStrike === next.isStrike
    );
  },
});

TITLE: React NodeView Performance Optimization
DESCRIPTION: This significant update improves React NodeView performance by using useSyncExternalStore for synchronization and reducing re-renders through better portal management.

LANGUAGE: markdown
CODE:
e31673d: This PR significantly improves the performance of React NodeViews in a couple of ways:

- It now uses useSyncExternalStore to synchronize changes between React & the editor instance
- It dramatically reduces the number of re-renders by re-using instances of React portals that have already been initialized and unaffected by the change made in the editor

We were seeing performance problems with React NodeViews because a change to one of them would cause a re-render to all instances of node views. For an application that heavily relies on node views in React, this was quite expensive.
This should dramatically cut down on the number of instances that have to re-render, and, making each of those re-renders much less costly.

----------------------------------------

TITLE: React 19 Compatibility Updates
DESCRIPTION: Multiple changes to ensure compatibility with React 19, including adjustments to how refs work and using useLayoutEffect instead of useEffect for state management.

LANGUAGE: markdown
CODE:
5eee480: React 19 changes how refs works, it will double mount them, all that we needed to do though was to use the JSX transform instead of createElement directly #5846

LANGUAGE: markdown
CODE:
7619215: This changes useEditorState to use the useLayoutEffect hook instead of the useEffect hook, so that state that might render to the page can be committed in one pass instead of two.

LANGUAGE: markdown
CODE:
7619215: Fixes an issue where the bubble and flaoting menus on blur would remount

LANGUAGE: markdown
CODE:
7619215: React 19 is now allowed as a peer dep, we did not have to make any changes for React 19

----------------------------------------

TITLE: Shallow Options Diffing in TipTap Editor
DESCRIPTION: This patch implements a shallow diffing mechanism between current and incoming editor options to determine if a state update is necessary. It uses referential equality for comparison, avoiding known problematic options like callbacks and extensions.

LANGUAGE: markdown
CODE:
40b7d47: This does a shallow diff between the current options and the incoming ones to determine whether we should try to write the new options and incur a state update within the editor.

It purposefully is not doing a full diff as several options are known to be problematic (callback handlers, extensions array, the content itself), so we rely on referential equality only to do this diffing which should be fairly fast since there are only about 10-15 options, and this diffs only the ones the user has actually attempted to set. Some options (e.g. editorProps, parseOptions, coreExtensionOptions) are an object that may need to be memoized by the user if they want to avoid unnecessary state updates.

TITLE: useEditor and useEditorState Optimization
DESCRIPTION: This patch optimizes the useEditor and useEditorState hooks to reduce the number of instances created while maintaining performance.

LANGUAGE: markdown
CODE:
7c8889a: Optimize `useEditor` and `useEditorState` to reduce number of instances created while still being performant #5432

The core of this change is two-fold:

- have the effect run on every render (i.e. without a dep array)
- schedule destruction of instances, but bail on the actual destruction if the instance was still mounted and a new instance had not been created yet

It should plug a memory leak, where editor instances could be created but not cleaned up in strict mode.
As well as fixing a bug where a re-render, with deps, was not applying new options that were set on `useEditor`.
